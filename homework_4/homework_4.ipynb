    "\n",
    "- HW_weight: The weight towards the final grade of the score on all homeworks.\n",

    "- Part_weight: The weight towards the final grade of the score on all participation scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT:  For the HW and participation categories, the final percentage is (# points earned)/(# of points possible).  So, for example, if there were two HWs and you got 10/10 and 7/8, your final percentage on HW would be 17/18.\n",

    "- Add to df_grades a column labeled \"Final_perc\", which gives the final percentage (this should be between 0 and 100 for each student) achieved by each student given the specified weighting scheme that is given as input.  Note that it may be helpful to add other columns along the way, this is okay.\n",
